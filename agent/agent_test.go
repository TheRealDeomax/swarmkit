func TestAgent(t *testing.T) {
	// TODO(stevvooe): The current agent is fairly monolithic, making it hard
	// to test without implementing or mocking an entire master. We'd like to
	// avoid this, as these kinds of tests are expensive to maintain.
	//
	// To support a proper testing program, the plan is to decouple the agent
	// into the following components:
	//
	// 	Connection: Manages the RPC connection and the available managers. Must
	// 	follow lazy grpc style but also expose primitives to force reset, which
	// 	is currently exposed through picker.
	//
	//	Session: Manages the lifecycle of an agent from Register to a failure.
	//	Currently, this is implemented as Agent.session but we'd prefer to
	//	encapsulate it to keep the agent simple.
	//
	// 	Agent: With the above scaffolding, the agent reduces to Agent.Assign
	// 	and Agent.Watch. Testing becomes as simple as assigning tasks sets and
	// 	checking that the appropriate events come up on the watch queue.
	//
	// We may also move the Assign/Watch to a Driver type and have the agent
	// oversee everything.
